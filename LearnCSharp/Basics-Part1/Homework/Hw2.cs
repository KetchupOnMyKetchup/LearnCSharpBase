            // What value is num now?
            // Answer:


            // Call your method called ChangeNum, do not assign the method to the variable num


            // What value will num be now?
            // Answer:


            // Set your exisiting variable num (do NOT create a new variable) equal to the ChangeNum method


            // What value will num be now?
            // Answer:


            // Write a variable called num2 and set it equal to 4


            // Call your ChangeNum2 method and pass in num2 as a parameter, do not assign the method to a variable


            // What value will num be now?
            // Answer:


            // Set your variable num equal to the ChangeNum2 method


            // What value will num be now?
            // Answer:


            // Write a variable called num3 and set it equal to 5


            // Set your variable num equal to num3. 


            // What value will num be now?
