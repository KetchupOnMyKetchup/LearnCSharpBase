# Overview
This code base is intended:
- To help people learn how to program in C# who have no dev or C# experience at all. 
- To have working projects, homework, and links for mentors who want to teach someone C#.
- To provide clean code in order of increasing difficulty for self-study with programs that work and have related homework assignments.  All projects have a workign solution, see bottom of page to see what projects are included. 

The ideal scenario is if you can find a dev to help walk you through these exercises, or someone who is willing to help out as needed/help with questions.  If not, these exercises can also be done alone but you will probably need help getting started with Visual Studio.

# Syllabus
Pair with the following syllabus I created and use this as a way to measure progress and a guide to what you need to learn to become a junior C# .NET developer: http://www.crystaltenn.com/2020/03/learn-c-from-scratch-comprehensive.html

# Pre-requisites
### Download Visual Studio Community (free)
- Go to the following url to download Visual Studio Community which is free: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/
- If you have any issues installing or don't know what to install, go here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbbIesdfCSI

### Install Git (free)
- https://git-scm.com/downloads *Just hit Next on the installer and get all defaults

### Interactive C# Tutorial 
- [Interactive C# tutorials for basic knowledge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/)

### Visual Studio 
- [Getting Started with Visual Studio 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CgsMtUmVgs)  **Version 2019 doesn't matter, this will apply to newer versions
- [C# Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhQdlIFylQ8) It's 4.5 hours but will get you started and is well worth the time and will prevent you from struggling through how to use VS because you can follow along in the tutorial video.

# How to Use This Guide
This guide can be used with no experience programming at all. Go into the Program.cs file and follow the instructions and order there. This would be best used with the mentorship/help of a C# developer.  The ideal scenario is for a 1:1 pair programming between a mentor and mentee and for the mentor to use this project as a guidance and help as needed and especially for the mentor to kickstart how to use Visual Studio, do basic work, and help a lot with the first few projects.
