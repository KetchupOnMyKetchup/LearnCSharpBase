# Overview
This guide and code base is intended:
- **Self study**: For anyone who wants to learn how to program in C# with no dev or C# experience at all.  The videos in the pre-reqs section should be enough to get you started on basics, and this project and repo is intended to be more in depth with hands-on projects and homework with solutions.
- **Mentors**: For mentors to give a set of working projects, homework, and links to teach someone C#.
- To provide clean code in order of increasing difficulty to get hands-on practice with C# specifically (no front-end or databases, just learning how to do dev), a syllabus for progress, and enough videos to get started on your own without any help.  Additional external content is linked for you to continue your journey later and learn how to do web development technologies or try out making a full application connecting to a database. 
- **To be completely free!!!** Nothing in this guide costs money, this guide and everything linked in it is free, you can teach yourself to do C# dev without paying a dime! 

# Syllabus
- http://www.crystaltenn.com/2020/03/learn-c-from-scratch-comprehensive.html
- Pair with the above syllabus and use this as a way to measure progress and a guide to what you need to go from zero dev experience to learn to become a junior C# .NET developer.

# Pre-requisites
### Download Visual Studio Community (free)
- [Download Visual Studio Community which is free](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
- If you have any issues installing or don't know what to install, [then click here for help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbbIesdfCSI) 

### Install Git (free)
- https://git-scm.com/downloads *Just hit Next on the installer and get all defaults

### Interactive C# Tutorial 
- [Interactive C# tutorials for basic knowledge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/)

### Visual Studio 
- [Getting Started with Visual Studio 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CgsMtUmVgs)  **Version 2019 doesn't matter, this will apply to newer versions

# How to Use This Guide
1. Go into the `Program.cs` file and follow the instructions and order there.  If you do not have a mentor or do not know how to use Visual Studio, watch the video linked above or click here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhQdlIFylQ8
1. Go through Part 1 and complete all hw and projects
1. After part 1, watch the below materials to watch after Part 1, and before starting Part 2 about Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- [Object-oriented Programming in 7 minutes | Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTB0EiLXUC8)
- [Intro to Object Oriented Programming - Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiBw7os-_zI)
1. Go through part 2 and complete all hw and projects
1. Go through additional content as needed
1. Go through interview questions online to see if you have any gaps in knowledge, you can search things like `C# interview questions` for example to get an idea of what could be asked. 

# Content
### Basics Part 1 (everything before classes)
Learn types, variables, methods, collections (arrays and lists), and loops

#### Additional advice for if you have a mentor or are a mentor:
- If mentors can setup a GitHub or Azure DevOps project and work with you on a sprint basis, help you break down work into Epics/Features/User Stories/Tasks and teach you how to work in an Agile/Scrum environment this will help you adjust to working and estimating work.  Also then you will understand what it's like to be in a sprint in a very hands-on manner. 
- If mentors can have you fork this repo, then create a branch, do your work, do a pull request, describe what you did, then they review and leave comments on your pull request, you will learn how developers push and work on code everyday! Also it will really help you with your Git skills and confidence! 
- The above two will help you with both interviews and working in your actual job and help ease your transition into dev work!
