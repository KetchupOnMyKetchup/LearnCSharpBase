# Overview
This guide and code base is intended:
- **Self study**: For anyone who wants to learn how to program in C# with no dev or C# experience at all.  The videos in the pre-reqs section should be enough to get you started on basics, and this project and repo is intended to be more in depth with hands-on projects and homework with solutions.
- **Mentors**: For mentors to give a set of working projects, homework, and links to teach someone C#.
- To provide clean code in order of increasing difficulty to get hands-on practice, a syllabus for progress, and enough videos to get started on your own without any help.

# Syllabus
Pair with the following syllabus I created and use this as a way to measure progress and a guide to what you need to learn to become a junior C# .NET developer: http://www.crystaltenn.com/2020/03/learn-c-from-scratch-comprehensive.html

# Pre-requisites
### Download Visual Studio Community (free)
- [Download Visual Studio Community which is free](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
- If you have any issues installing or don't know what to install, [then click here for help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbbIesdfCSI) 

### Install Git (free)
- https://git-scm.com/downloads *Just hit Next on the installer and get all defaults

### Interactive C# Tutorial 
- [Interactive C# tutorials for basic knowledge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/)

### Visual Studio 
- [Getting Started with Visual Studio 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CgsMtUmVgs)  **Version 2019 doesn't matter, this will apply to newer versions
- [Learn to code in Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/getting-started/) **Must watch the video labelled "Getting Started with Visual Studio IDE" within this link!

Take your pick between the below two, do both, do one of them, but use this to learn how to use Visual Studio and get started with programming in C#.  If you are working alone you will 100% need one or both of these to get started:
- [C# Tutorial For Beginners - Learn C# Basics in 1 Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfkTfcpWqAY) (1 hour)
- [C# Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhQdlIFylQ8) (4.5 hours)

  - Rock paper scissors
- Collections: Lists, arrays
- Loops: for, while, foreach, do
- Dealing with Null
- Setting variables to methods return variables
- Methods
- Different syntaxes / shortcut (syntatical sugar) syntaxes

### Basics Part 2 (classes and OOP)
Learn classes, properties, constructors, and basic object oriented programming
- Classes, properties, methods in classes
- Separating large projects into multiple classes, namespaces, accessors (public, private, internal, etc)
- Class constructors
- Class inheritance, interfaces .. Object oriented programming
- Method overloading
- Unit testing
- Debugging practice, fix broken code!

The following is a screenshot of the contents in Visual Studio:

# If you have a mentor.. additional advice:
- If mentors can setup a GitHub or Azure DevOps project and work with you on a sprint basis, help you break down work into Epics/Features/User Stories/Tasks and teach you how to work in an Agile/Scrum environment this will help you adjust to working and estimating work.  Also then you will understand what it's like to be in a sprint in a very hands-on manner. 
- If mentors can have you fork this repo, then create a branch, do your work, do a pull request, describe what you did, then they review and leave comments on your pull request, you will learn how developers push and work on code everyday! Also it will really help you with your Git skills and confidence! 
- The above two will help you with both interviews and working in your actual job and help ease your transition into dev work!

# Additional Self-Study Content
These resources are unrelated to Project and can be done at anytime before/after/during project content but are very useful to becoming a software engineer and will help you get started at work quicker.
