# LearnCSharp
This should be paired with the following syllabus I created here and it approximately follows it: http://www.crystaltenn.com/2020/03/learn-c-from-scratch-comprehensive.html

### Overview
This code base is intended:
- To help people learn how to program in C# who have no dev or C# experience at all. 
- To have working projects, homework, and links for mentors who want to teach someone C#.
- To provide clean code in order of increasing difficulty for self-study. 

Click on the LearnCSharp folder to see the contents. There are projects to practice and they are in order of difficulty and building knowledge.  

The ideal scenario is if you can find a dev to help walk you through these exercises, or someone who is willing to help out as needed/help with questions.  If not, these exercises can also be done alone but you will probably need help getting started with Visual Studio.

The solution is split into the following parts:
- LearnCSharp: Foundations of C# for those with no dev experience. 
  - Basics Part 1: Learn types, variables, methods, collections (arrays and lists), and loops
  - Basics Part 2: Learn classes, properties, constructors, and basic object oriented programming

# Pre-requisites
### Download Visual Studio Community (free)

# Table of Contents / Syllabus / How to Use This Guide
This guide can be used with no experience programming at all. Go into the Program.cs file and follow the instructions and order there. This would be best used with the mentorship/help of a C# developer.  The ideal scenario is for a 1:1 pair programming between a mentor and mentee and for the mentor to use this project as a guidance and help as needed and especially for the mentor to kickstart how to use Visual Studio, do basic work, and help a lot with the first few projects. 

### Basics Part 1 (everything before classes)
- Project 1: Intro and Fizz Buzz Problem
- Project 2a: Simple Calculator to Add, Subtract, Divide, Multiply 2 numbers. No separate methods and expanded variable assignment
- Project 2b: Similar Calculator with separate methods
- Types, variables + initialization, methods, parameters, if/else, case/switch
  - Calculator
  - Tic Tac Toe
  - Rock paper scissors
- Collections: Lists, arrays
- Loops: for, while, foreach, do
- Dealing with Null
- Setting variables to methods return variables
- Methods
- Different syntaxes / shortcut (syntatical sugar) syntaxes

### Basics Part 2 (classes and OOP)
- Classes, properties, methods in classes
- Separating large projects into multiple classes, namespaces, accessors (public, private, internal, etc)
- Class constructors
- Class inheritance, interfaces .. Object oriented programming
- Method overloading
- Unit testing
- Debugging practice, fix broken code!
