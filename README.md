# LearnCSharp
THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND NOT COMPLETED YET. LAST UPDATE 8/28/21
### Overview
This code base is intended:
- To help people learn how to program in C# who have no dev or C# experience at all. 
- To have working projects, homework, and links for mentors who want to teach someone C#.
- To provide clean code in order of increasing difficulty for self-study. 

Click on the LearnCSharp folder to see the contents. There are projects to practice and they are in order of difficulty and building knowledge.  

The ideal scenario is if you can find a local dev to help walk you through these exercises, or someone who is willing to help out as needed/help with questions.  If not, these exercises can also be done alone. 

The solution is split into the following parts:
- LearnCSharp: Foundations of C# for those with no dev experience. 
  - Basics Part 1: Learn types, variables, methods, collections (arrays and lists), and loops
  - Basics Part 2: Learn classes, properties, constructors, and basic object oriented programming
- ToDoList App: End to End solution with Front-end, API layer, and DB connection (TBD)
- ShoeDistribuitor App
- \asdf
